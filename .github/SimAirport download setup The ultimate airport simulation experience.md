## Tips and Tricks for Playing SimAirport
 
SimAirport is a game that requires a lot of planning, strategy, and creativity. You have to balance your budget, satisfy your customers, and deal with various challenges and events. To help you succeed in your airport business, here are some tips and tricks that you can use.

- Use queue lines to organize your passengers and staff. You can assign multiple desks (ID, ticketing, gate) to a single queue line or a pair of queue lines (coach/first class) and that will make passengers round-robin around the facilities[^1^]. You can also use security exit gates to direct arriving passengers out of the airport instead of through it[^2^].
- Hire enough staff for your airport operations. You need staff to work at the desks, security checkpoints, baggage handling, and loading/unloading planes. Staff is your main center of cost, so don't hire more than you need[^2^]. You can also make sure that staff can walk from ticketing to boarding desks as needed, so you can run understaffed and save money in the early phases[^1^].
- Build a proper baggage system with the baggage routing system. This will automate the process of moving bags from check-in to planes and vice versa. You will need conveyor belts, scanners, sorters, and baggage claim areas. This will save you time and money and make your passengers happier[^2^].
- Expand your main road and parking lot as your airport grows. You will need more space for construction trucks, delivery vehicles, buses, taxis, and private cars. You can only build on the right side of the prebuilt road for now[^2^], so plan ahead and leave some space for expansion.
- Use vending machines instead of cafes for food and drinks. Vending machines are less costly, faster, and less likely to have stuck people. They also don't require staff or food workers to operate. You can place them near waiting areas or gates to provide convenience for your passengers[^2^].

These are some of the tips and tricks that can help you play SimAirport better. There are many more things to learn and discover in this game, so feel free to experiment and have fun. If you encounter any problems or bugs, you can contact the developers or visit their forums for support.
